I work as an embedded systems dev engineer at [RoverDx](https://www.roverdx.com/), a Columbia University advancing next-generation point-of-care PCR diagnostics. At RoverDx, I design and implement embedded firmware and real-time control systems for sample preparation.

I hold an MS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Robotics and Controls at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I conducted research in modular robotics and robotic metabolism at the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/).  

Earlier, I gained systems experience at [Hyundai Motor Group](https://www.hyundaimotorgroup.com/main/mainRecommend), where I led the co-design of a cross-brand ML safety data analytics system architecture—partnering with Hyundai, Kia, and Deloitte.

**My work is dedicated to developing robotic algorithms and systems.**

**Focus Areas: Robotics Algorithms and Systems · Real-time Control and Planning · Machine Learning**
