I am a second-year MS student in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Robotics at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). As a member of the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/), I work under the guidance of Professor Hod Lipson and Philippe Wyder in the Robot Metabolism Group. Before joining Columbia, I received a Bachelor's degree from [CAU](https://www.cau.ac.kr/) and gained valuable industry experience at [Hyundai Motor Group](https://www.hyundaimotorgroup.com/main/mainRecommend), where I contributed to automotive projects for the brands Hyundai and Kia. **My work is dedicated to understanding the learning mechanisms of robots and developing innovative robotic solutions that serve society and assist individuals.**


**Research Interests: Modular Robotics 路  AI 路  Robotic Manipulation and Control 路  Rehabilitation Robotics 路 Exo-Skeleton**
